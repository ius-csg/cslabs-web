# CS Labs Web

## Description
CS Labs is aimed to create a full environment for learning without the issues of "works on my machine". This project 
provides both class and independent learning modules. There are other solutions out there but this one is free
for IUS and provides reasonable pricing for outside users.

This team covers the front end web app, the backend, database entities, and spinning up and down Labs using 
Proxmox provided by the CS Labs Infrastructure team.
